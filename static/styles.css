/* Minimal legacy overrides preserved for compatibility; most styling is done with Tailwind.
   As templates have been migrated, several legacy helper rules were removed here
   to encourage Tailwind usage. We keep a small GIF sizing rule and `.disabled`
   for compat with any remaining static previews. Remove this file when the
   repo has been fully migrated.
*/

/* Migration note: legacy gif sizing and `.disabled` helper removed — templates
   use Tailwind utilities and explicit image classes now. Keep a minimal
   compatibility note here during transition.
