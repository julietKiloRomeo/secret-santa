# Reindeer Rush

advent game 3

Progress:

- [DONE] Backend leaderboard support exists via `/api/scores/<game>` (already in app).
- [DONE] Added game to defaults: `reindeer-rush` now included in DB defaults.
- [DONE] Added route and placeholder template: `/reindeer-rush` -> `templates/reindeer_rush.html`.
- [DONE] Added automated tests: `tests/test_reindeer_rush.py`.
- [DONE] Minimal client skeleton and leaderboard UI added (`static/reindeer_rush.js`, template updated).
- [TODO] Full client gameplay implementation (physics, controls, sprites, collisions).
 - [IN PROGRESS] Full client gameplay implementation (basic physics, controls, obstacles, collisions).
   - Implemented a minimal playable client using a canvas in `static/reindeer_rush.js` (jump, spawn obstacles, collision detection, distance scoring, game-over + submit overlay).
   - Added a small server-side smoke test: `tests/test_reindeer_rush_client.py` to verify the page and script are present.
- [TODO] Art assets: sprites (~20), background tiles.
- [TODO] Sounds and music (~8 assets) and volume/mute support.
- [TODO] Power-ups and polish (shield bell, flying boost, particle effects).

  - `Reindeer Rush` — Endless runner/dodger: Guide a reindeer through a scrolling winter landscape, jumping over frozen ponds and ducking under low-hanging icicles while collecting carrots and candy canes. Could have a simple tap-to-jump mechanic (one tap = small jump, hold = big jump) with gradually increasing speed. Stars or special items could give temporary flying boosts with a trail of sparkles.
- Scores are stored in a SQLite database and surfaced through HTTP APIs. Admin users can manage games and reset high scores.

# Reindeer Rush - Simple Spec

- Ground tile

Simple, fun, 5-minute mini-game vibes!

## Implementation Notes
- Mobile layout is landscape-only and stretches the canvas to fill the entire screen, keeping the reindeer and background art as the only real estate; UI chrome is limited to a small floating distance/score readout if needed.
- Input uses a swipe gesture onto the canvas (tap/swipe up to jump, swipe down to duck) with no buttons, so the view remains unobstructed.
- Obstacles, collectible placements, and spacing are procedurally generated while the game auto-increments speed, spawn density, and power-up frequency to keep the challenge growing.
- Art focus is on a detailed animated reindeer character; background detail should support a scenic, high-polish look without extra HUD or overlays.
