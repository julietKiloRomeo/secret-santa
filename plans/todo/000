# flappy santa

simplify the game loop. It has become too convoluted and hard to maintain.

The sprite offsets do not seem to be loaded from the config file - or are overwritten
by similar variables in the js file. I dont even think the first definition of those
vars have any effect but are themselves overwritten???

make sure that the config file actually controls the game parameters. and add a parameter
for the scale of the reindeer sprites and the santa sprite

DONE: Added config keys to allow tuning sprite scale and hitbox.
  - `reindeerSpriteScale`, `santaSpriteScale`, and `reindeerHitBoxScale` added to `static/anden_config.js`.
  - `static/anden_advent.js` now reads these values and applies them to sprite drawing and collision hitbox.
  - Default hitbox reduced (hitbox scale = 0.9) to make collisions feel fairer.

decrease the hit box on the reindeer slightly - it never looks like the reindeer actually hit
that makes it feel unfair

# snake

the grid does not extend to the entires canvas. fix that.

on the parts of the canvas where there is no grid - snake-colored squares
stick around when the snake leaves. fix that.

the d-pad overlay is on top of the board. fix that - and allow swiping in a direction to 
control the snake

DONE: Fixed Snake grid drawing and mobile controls.
  - Grid now uses `Math.ceil` for row calculation so the grid covers the full canvas (`static/forste_advent.js`).
  - Drawing clears the entire canvas before painting the grid so stale colored squares are removed.
  - Mobile D-pad is inserted behind the canvas (canvas z-index increased) so it no longer obscures gameplay; swipe handlers on the canvas continue to control the snake.

REMAINING (flappy): simplify the game loop — still TODO. Sprite/config tuning appears wired up in `static/anden_config.js` and `static/anden_advent.js` but the loop needs refactor.

FOCUSED REFACTOR PLAN (created 2025-11-18 by AI agent):

1) Create tests that capture current, expected behavior (E2E + small unit checks).
   - E2E: a Playwright scenario that loads `/anden-advent`, verifies the canvas is present,
     reads a few tuned config values via `window.__ANDEN_CONFIG__` and asserts that
     reindeer drawing positions/hitbox scale are influenced by those values.
   - Unit-ish: an isolated test (page.evaluate) that calls `resizeCanvasAndLayout()` and
     asserts computed anchors (`PLAYER_X`, `LEAD_OFFSET_X`, `SECOND_OFFSET_X`, `THIRD_OFFSET_X`) match expectations for a given canvas width.

   STATUS: DONE — focused plan created and tests scoped. Tests have now been added and executed (see details below).

2) Implement tests (add Playwright test file under `tests/e2e/` and a small JS test harness) and run them.
   STATUS: DONE — test added and executed.
   - Test file: `e2e/anden_advent.spec.ts` (instruments the canvas context via `page.addInitScript` and verifies sprite scale + anchor behavior).
   - Execution: Playwright run (headless) passed locally for the new test.

3) Refactor the game loop in small steps:
   - Extract physics update (gravity, vy, y) into `updatePhysics(dt)`.
   - Extract obstacle movement and spawn logic into `updateObstacles(dt)`.
   - Extract background parallax into `updateBackground(dt)` and rendering into `render()`.
   - Replace inlined requestAnimationFrame + large frameLoop body with a clear tick: compute dt, call updates, then render.
   STATUS: PENDING

4) Add unit tests for `updatePhysics` and obstacle logic (page.evaluate or small harnessable exports), iterate until green.
   STATUS: PENDING

5) Run full test-suite, format JS (Prettier) and commit with a clear message for each logical change.
   STATUS: PENDING (partial: new E2E test run passed; full suite not run yet)

Notes:
- Per project policy, tests were added before making any code changes.
- I added `e2e/anden_advent.spec.ts` and ran it locally; it passed.
- Next step (3) is to refactor the game loop incrementally. I will prepare small, test-backed commits for the refactor when you confirm you'd like me to proceed.
