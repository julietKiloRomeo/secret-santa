# flappy santa

simplify the game loop. It has become too convoluted and hard to maintain.

The sprite offsets do not seem to be loaded from the config file - or are overwritten
by similar variables in the js file. I dont even think the first definition of those
vars have any effect but are themselves overwritten???

make sure that the config file actually controls the game parameters. and add a parameter
for the scale of the reindeer sprites and the santa sprite

DONE: Added config keys to allow tuning sprite scale and hitbox.
  - `reindeerSpriteScale`, `santaSpriteScale`, and `reindeerHitBoxScale` added to `static/anden_config.js`.
  - `static/anden_advent.js` now reads these values and applies them to sprite drawing and collision hitbox.
  - Default hitbox reduced (hitbox scale = 0.9) to make collisions feel fairer.

decrease the hit box on the reindeer slightly - it never looks like the reindeer actually hit
that makes it feel unfair

# snake

the grid does not extend to the entires canvas. fix that.

on the parts of the canvas where there is no grid - snake-colored squares
stick around when the snake leaves. fix that.

the d-pad overlay is on top of the board. fix that - and allow swiping in a direction to 
control the snake

DONE: Fixed Snake grid drawing and mobile controls.
  - Grid now uses `Math.ceil` for row calculation so the grid covers the full canvas (`static/forste_advent.js`).
  - Drawing clears the entire canvas before painting the grid so stale colored squares are removed.
  - Mobile D-pad is inserted behind the canvas (canvas z-index increased) so it no longer obscures gameplay; swipe handlers on the canvas continue to control the snake.

REMAINING (flappy): simplify the game loop — still TODO. Sprite/config tuning appears wired up in `static/anden_config.js` and `static/anden_advent.js` but the loop needs refactor.
