## Visual & Input Notes
- The mobile canvas runs in landscape so the entire screen becomes the stage for a scenic snow valley; there are no button overlays, only the reindeer, terrain, and minimalistic score text when needed.
- Input relies on swipe gestures on the canvas: swipe up or tap to jump, swipe down to duck, with responsive physics and no distracting UI controls.
- The reindeer art takes precedence—prioritize a polished animated hero and supportive parallax background layers to create a lush shot of the holiday landscape.
